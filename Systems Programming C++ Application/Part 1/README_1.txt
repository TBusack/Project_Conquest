matrix_calc.cpp is a program that handles arithmetic functions related to 1-dimensional matricies

To run this program on Windows, first ensure you have the proper compiler installed and have navigated to the right directory
Then type g++ -Wall run_matrix.cpp Matrix.cpp -lm â€“o runM

In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the compiled program is stored and input "runM"

If you receive an error before running the program, you are likely in the wrong directory or did not properly compile the program.

If you receive and error while the program in running, the code may be incorrect or was improperly handled by your compiler
The files missing may not prompt an error and may run fine but fail to complete the task.

You may also see an error message given by the program if the matricies are different sizes
